    <p style="color: white">Information about Africa:</p>
    <p style="color: white">
      Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most populous continent,
      after Asia in both cases. At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square
      miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface
      area and 20% of its land area.[7] With 1.4 billion people[1][2] as of
      2021, it accounts for about 18% of the world's human population. Africa's
      population is the youngest amongst all the continents;[8][9] the median
      age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4.[10] Despite
      a wide range of natural resources, Africa is the least wealthy continent
      per capita and second-least wealthy by total wealth, behind Oceania.
      Scholars have attributed this to different factors including geography,
      climate, tribalism,[11] colonialism, the Cold War,[17] neocolonialism,
      lack of democracy, and corruption.[11] Despite this low concentration of
      wealth, recent economic expansion and the large and young population make
      Africa an important economic market in the broader global context. The
      continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Isthmus
      of Suez and the Red Sea to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the
      southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes
      Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognised
      sovereign states, eight territories and two de facto independent states
      with limited or no recognition. Algeria is Africa's largest country by
      area, and Nigeria is its largest by population. African nations cooperate
      through the establishment of the African Union, which is headquartered in
      Addis Ababa.
